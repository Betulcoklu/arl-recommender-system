# Association Rule Learning for Market Basket Analysis 🛒

This project applies Association Rule Learning (ARL) to uncover hidden relationships between products using the **Online Retail II** dataset. The goal is to generate product recommendations for users based on their past purchases — like suggesting what a customer might buy next based on their current basket.

## 📌 Dataset

The dataset comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains information on transactions made by a UK-based and registered non-store online retailer.

- **Time Range:** 2010–2011
- **Features:** InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, Price, Customer ID, Country

## 🔧 Project Steps

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Removed missing values
- Filtered out canceled transactions (invoices starting with "C")
- Handled outliers in `Quantity` and `Price`

### 2. Invoice-Product Matrix Creation
- Created a matrix where each row is an invoice and each column is a product
- Marked whether a product is purchased (1) or not (0)

### 3. Association Rule Learning
- Used the `mlxtend` library to apply the **Apriori algorithm**
- Extracted rules based on metrics like `support`, `confidence`, and `lift`

### 4. Recommendation System
- Built a custom function `arl_recommender()` to suggest related products based on a given product ID
- Recommendations are generated by analyzing the most relevant association rules

## 📈 Sample Usage

```python
# Example: Get 3 recommendations for product ID 22492
arl_recommender(rules, product_id=22492, rec_count=3)

## 🧾 Sample Output
['9_4', '2_0', '38_4']
